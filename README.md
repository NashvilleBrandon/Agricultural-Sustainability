# Summary

This project tells a story about sustainable agriculture and explores why these are important. Data from the Food and Agriculture Organization was used to identify trends in global data that highlight why we need for more sustainable solutions in agriculture. The FAO monitors certain indicators that assist the United Nations in determining actions for their Sustainable Development Goals. There are a plethora of various indicators the FAO has custody over, and this project focuses on a few that I found particularly interesting. Version 1 of the presentation was designed to talk about this in under 10 minutes; however, I have included a Director's Cut of the presentation that goes into significantly more depth.

## Motivation
I have an interest for agriculture and how to increase the amount we produce as humans, and how we can do this sustainably. As more data becomes available specifically for alternative methods to conventional farming, I intend to add to this presentation as the data becomes available.

## Data Question
In the dataset, there are various SDG Indicator collected by the FAO. I looked at five of the many indicators for visualizing important trends, and developed an exploratory dashboard for any one else interested in this information.

# Presentation
This presentation consists of two parts: slides and dashboard. It was designed to be delivered within 10 minutes and a PDF copy of the visuals used are located in the /images folder of this repo. I do love talking about agriculture, so there are two versions. They are titled Agricultural Sustainability v1 and Agricultural Sustainability: Directors Cut. Links of me presenting on this topic can be found below. The latter of the two will continue receiving updates, since I love this topic so much and intend to present continuously in the future.

# Tools/Technicals
Tools used for this project are Python (Pandas & Matplotlib), Powerpoint, and Power BI. The Jupyter Notebook with detailed information about the code used for the charts in the presentation can be accessed in the notebooks folder.

In creating the dashboard, I transformed the data within Power BI Desktop by first creating a star-ish schema before designing layout and charts.


# Data/Sources
Data for this project can be accessed by going to the Food and Agriculture Organization website http://www.fao.org/sustainable-development-goals/indicators/en/
